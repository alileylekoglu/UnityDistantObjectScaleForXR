# UnityObjectScaleTransformation
This repository will help you efficiently scale your objects remotely using XR Interaction Toolkit 2.3 Unity for VR. The scale action is activated with the primary button (X), while it is deactivated with the release of the object. The scale is resized using the joystick while the scale mode is activated, preventing objects from moving and rotating freely. This code has been tested with the Oculus headset.

Requirements:
